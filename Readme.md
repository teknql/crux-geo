Geospatial indexing for [juxt/crux](https://github.com/juxt/crux).


## Configuration

To use `crux-geo` simply add the `:teknql.crux-geo/geo-store` to your crux configuration.

```clojure
(crux/start-node {:teknql.crux-geo/geo-store {}})
```

## Status

Currently in alpha. We believe the core functionality is there and are now seeking
early feedback. Still, APIs may change before cutting a real release.

## Writing Data

To express geospatial `crux-geo` expects maps with data similar to that as found
in the [GeoJSON Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).

Specifically maps should have two keys `:geometry/type` and
`:geometry/coordinates`. The following types are supported, using the same
coordinate patterns as seen in GeoJSON:

- `:geometry.type/point`
- `:geometry.type/multi-point`
- `:geometry.type/line-string`
- `:geometry.type/polygon`
- `:geometry.type/multi-polygon`

Below is an example of storing a city with a lng/lat point:


``` clojure
(crux/submit-tx
  [:crux.tx/put
   {:crux.db/id :city.id/new-york
    :city/location
    {:geometry/type        :geometry.type/point
     :geometry/coordinates [-74.0060 40.7128]}}])
```

#### A Note on Precision

At extremely high precisions there can be information loss between what is
stored in spatialite and what is stored in crux leading to situations where the
data cannot be joined on.

Currently we provide the `teknql.crux-geo.encode/truncate` function to truncate
a geometry to a lower precision. There really only seems to be issues with
geometries that have close to 13 decimals. Given that [9 decimal places
approaches microspociy](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/8674) this shouldn't be
too much of an issue. The note is that you must truncate before you index into Crux.

Another option that we have considered is storing the raw data inside sqlite so
that it can be recovered without any rounding that spatialite performs. The
downside here is that it seems wasteful to be storing it, but opinions on this
are something that we are actively seeking feedback on.

## Querying Data

crux-geo provides a range of useful query operations. For a potentially more
complete reference, check the tests folder.

Consider a database with the following data:

``` clojure
[{:crux.db/id :city.id/new-york
  :city/location
  {:geometry/type        :geometry.type/point
   :geometry/coordinates [-74.0060 40.7128]}}
 {:crux.db/id :city.id/boston
  :city/location
  {:geometry/type        :geometry.type/point
   :geometry/coordinates [-71.0589 42.3601]}}
 {:crux.db/id :city.id/chicago
  :city/location
  {:geometry/type        :geometry.type/point
   :geometry/coordinates [-87.6298 41.8781]}}]
```


### Nearest Geometries

``` clojure

(crux/q
  (crux/db node)
  '{:find  [?nearest]
    :where [[?ny :crux.db/id :city.id/new-york]
            [?ny :city/location ?loc]
            [(geo-nearest :city/location ?loc) [[?nearest]]]]})
=> #{[:city.id/boston]}
```

The second argument in the resulting tuple can be used to immediately grab the
matched location without needing to query it from the attribute:

``` clojure

(crux/q
  (crux/db node)
  '{:find  [?nearest ?nearest-loc]
    :where [[?ny :crux.db/id :city.id/new-york]
            [?ny :city/location ?loc]
            [(geo-nearest :city/location ?loc) [[?nearest ?nearest-loc]]]]})
=>
#{[:city.id/boston
  {:geometry/coordinates [-71.0589 42.3601],
   :geometry/type        :geometry.type/point}]}
```

#### Getting `N` nearest

You may optionally provide a number to `geo-nearest` to query for the `n`
nearest items:

``` clojure
(crux/q
  (crux/db node)
  '{:find     [?nearest]
    :order-by [[?nearest :asc]]
    :where    [[?ny :crux.db/id :city.id/new-york]
               [?ny :city/location ?loc]
               [(geo-nearest :city/location ?loc 2) [[?nearest]]]]})
=> [[:city.id/boston] [:city.id/chicago]]
```

### Intersecting Geometries

The `geo-intersects` predicate may be used to filter for values that intersect
with each other. Here is an example that uses a bounding box
(`:geometry.type/polygon`) to search for cities contained within:

``` clojure
(crux/q
  (crux/db node)
  '{:find  [?city]
    :in    [bounding-box]
    :where [[(geo-intersects :city/location bounding-box) [[?city]]]]}
  {:geometry/type :geometry.type/polygon
   :geometry/coordinates
   [[[-74.04853820800781 40.6920928987952]
     [-73.92013549804688 40.6920928987952]
     [-73.92013549804688 40.78834006798032]
     [-74.04853820800781 40.78834006798032]
     [-74.04853820800781 40.6920928987952]]]})
=> #{[:city.id/new-york]}
```

Similar to `geo-nearest`, `geo-intersects` can also return the value of the
matched attribute as an additional argument to the binding tuple.

## Backends

### JTS (In-Memory, Pure Java)

```clojure
(crux/start-node
  {:teknql.crux-geo/geo-store {}})
```

By default crux-geo will use a pure-java in-memory backend built on top
of [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts).

Currently it stores all values in in-memory STRtrees partitioned by attribute.
These trees are automatically re-built using the index stores at node startup.

Anecdotally indexing a collection of approximately 800K polygons uses approximately 400MB of memory.

### Spatialite (SQLite, In-Memory or on Disk, Dynamically Linked)

For larger datasets we recommend using Spatialite, a geo-spatial extension for
Sqlite.

To use this you must have sqlite3 (tested with `v3.35.5`) and spatialite (tested
with `v5.0.1`) available on your system to be loaded dynamically at run time.

You must also add the JNA bindings to your `deps.edn`:

```clojure
{com.github.gwenn/sqlite-jna {:mvn/version "0.2.0"}}
```


```clojure
(crux/start-node
  {:teknql.crux-geo/geo-store
   {:backend
    {:crux/module 'teknql.crux-geo.spatialite/->backend
     :db-path "/tmp/geo.sqlite" ;; Or ":memory:" for in-memory
     }}})
```

#### Note on why JNA vs JDBC

Some may wonder why we chose to use the JNA bindings instead of the JDBC driver.
The JDBC driver statically compiles sqlite3 and packages with its JAR.
Spatialite, however, is not in that JAR, and the dynamically loaded version can
then hit issues where the system provided sqlite3 library is not compatible with
the version packaged in the JDBC driver, leading to JVM crashes. Rather than
maintain our own version of the JDBC driver we decide leave the challenges of
reproducible builds / runtime environments to other tools (operating system
package managers, docker, nix) and instead just assume to be able to load it
from the system path.
